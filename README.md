This mini project titled Hospital Management System is developed using C# to demonstrate core OOP concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism through method overriding. It features classes like Doctor, Patient, and Nurse inheriting from a common Person class, each with their own specific behavior. As part of my journey to become a .NET Full Stack Developer (Fresher), I build small projects daily to apply what I learn and strengthen my practical coding skills in C#. This is my second project after successfully completing my Traffic Rules Management System, and it boosted my confidence in understanding and applying object-oriented principlesÂ effectively.
